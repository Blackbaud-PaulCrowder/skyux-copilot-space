# Vertical Tabs Design Guidelines

## Component Overview
Vertical tabs divide and categorize content on pages with a large number of categories.

## Usage

### ✅ Use when

Use vertical tabs when you expect horizontal tabs to exceed the available horizontal space because of the number of tabs or the length of tab labels.

Use collapsible groups to organize vertical tabs that fit naturally into multiple categories.

### ❌ Don't use when

Don't use vertical tabs when horizontal tabs are appropriate. If the expected number of tabs is small and grouping is not necessary, use horizontal tabs instead.

Don't use vertical tabs as containers for other tabs. Change the workflow instead of nesting multiple sets of tabs.

Don't use vertical tabs when the workflow requires users to view and perform actions on each tab. Use split views instead.

Don't use vertical tabs in modals. Use sectioned forms instead. The two approaches look similar, but sectioned forms have additional features, such as displaying validation errors in form sections.
