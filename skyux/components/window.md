Â Window
======

The application window reference service references the global `window` variable. After users inject `SkyAppWindowRef` into a component, they can use the service to interact with `window` properties and event handlers by referencing its `nativeWindow` property. For more information, see the [window API documentation on MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window).
