Card
====

The [card](/skyux/components/card.md) component is deprecated, but SKY UX plans to develop a new version of this feature for some card use cases. In the meantime, to find other SKY UX components that group and list content, see the [content containers](/skyux/design/guidelines/content-containers.md) guidelines.

How to migrate
--------------

](/skyux/learn/develop/deprecation/card#how-to-migrate.md)

SKY UX hasn't created a migration script because we won't have a clear migration path until we develop the new version of the feature. Teams can move away from the card component on their own, but we intend to have tooling and better guidelines in the future.
