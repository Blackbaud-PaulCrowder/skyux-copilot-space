# List Toolbar Design Guidelines

## Component Overview
The list toolbar component displays a toolbar for a SKY UX-themed list of data. Lists and their features are deprecated. We will remove them in a future major version. We recommend using data manager instead.

## Usage

### âœ… Use when

Do use the list toolbar above a list of records to display actions that manipulate the contents of the list. Place frequently used actions directly in the toolbar, and place less-frequently used actions in a more actions menu. When multiple views of the list are available, the view switcher is docked on the right side of the toolbar.

## Options

### Composition

For more information about how to arrange content in a list toolbar, see the toolbar design guidelines.

### Sorting

If you use the toolbar with a grid view, you have two options to let users sort the list:

- The sort button in the toolbar
- Clickable column headers

Don't use both sorting options on the same list because it can confuse users about which option is applied.
