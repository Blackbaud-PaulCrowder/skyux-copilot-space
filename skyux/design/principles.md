SKY UX design principles
========================

[

Focus on the workflow
---------------------

](/skyux/design/principles#focus-on-the-workflow.md)

### Keep users in context

Deliver what users need where they are. Don't make them go on an expedition.

### Structure content around tasks

Organize information and actions based on what users are trying to do, not on the structure of the database.

[

Empower users
-------------

](/skyux/design/principles#empower-users.md)

### Provide a starting point

Whether it's new users logging in for the first time or experienced users starting their day, help them get going by providing assistance and suggesting actions.

### Offload work from users

Allow users to focus on higher-level tasks by synthesizing data and automating as much as possible.

### Provide scaffolding for growth

Get users up to speed quickly and provide a path to get increased value out of the system over time.

[

Maintain a clean, cohesive interface
------------------------------------

### Attention should drive behavior

Attention is a scarce resource. Reserve attention-calling design elements for cases where you need to drive user behavior inside or outside the system.

### Optimize for the ecosystem

Use standard components as much as possible and consider designs in the full context of use so that the user experience across the ecosystem feels seamless.
