# Toast Design Guidelines

## Component Overview
Toasts display messages over page content and provide a common look and feel.

## Usage

### âœ… Use when

Use toasts when users need to know about changes in system state due to background processes.

Use toasts when information is important enough to notify users regardless of their current tasks or context.

## Content

Toasts provide lightweight, time-sensitive information that is relevant to users when it appears. They guide users on actions to take and should include links for those actions whenever possible.

The text must be clear and concise, and punctuation is subjective depending on the scenario.

## Behavior and states

If a toast is the only place users can see a message, display the toast until users manually close it. Only close toasts automatically if users can access the messages after the toasts close.
