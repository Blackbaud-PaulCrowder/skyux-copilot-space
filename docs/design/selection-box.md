# Selection Box Design Guidelines

## Component Overview
Selection boxes present users with a choice to make or a question to answer before proceeding with a one-time process.

## Usage

### ✅ Use when

Use selection boxes when users must make a choice or answer a standalone question before proceeding with a one-time process such as a setup or configuration task. Selection boxes represent the only decision on a page.

Use selection boxes when options are abstract or potentially unfamiliar to users. Use icons and descriptions to provide additional insight.

### ❌ Don't use when

Don't use selection boxes for repeatable tasks such as data entry. Use other selection controls, such as checkboxes or radio buttons, instead.

Don't use selection boxes for fewer than 3 options or more than 12 options. Use other selection controls instead.

## Options

### Icons

Use icons to add meaning and help users distinguish between options.

- Don't use icons if they don't add useful information.
- Don't reuse icons within a group of selection boxes.
- Don't use icons with some selection boxes in a group but not others.
- Don't use selection boxes with titles only. If neither icons nor descriptions are necessary, use other selection controls instead.

### Descriptions

Use descriptions to add meaning and help users distinguish between options.

- Don't use descriptions if they don't add useful information.
- Don't use descriptions with some selection boxes in a group but not others.
- Don't use selection boxes with titles only. If neither icons nor descriptions are necessary, use other selection controls instead.

## Behavior and states

### Responsiveness

On smaller viewports, selection boxes hide their icons and use smaller typography and tighter spacing.

## Content

## Layout

Selection boxes are center-aligned within a container based on the number of options and the container's width. Don't use other layouts with selection boxes.
