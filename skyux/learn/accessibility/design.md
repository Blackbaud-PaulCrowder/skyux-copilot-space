Design for accessibility
========================

Foundational principles for accessible experiences
--------------------------------------------------

Understanding the [four principles that make experiences accessible](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/intro#understanding-the-four-principles-of-accessibility) for people with disabilities is essential for having the mindset to create and evaluate SKY UX experiences that are accessible.

1.  **Perceivable** — The design must be Perceivable to all user senses.
2.  **Operable** — User interface components and navigation must be Operable for users to interact with the interface.
3.  **Understandable** — Information and the operation of the user interface must be Understandable.
4.  **Robust** — And content must be Robust enough for a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies, to reliably interpret it.

Understand users with differing abilities
-----------------------------------------

Evaluate your design ideas from the perspectives of users with disabilities. Become familiar with the [design issues and solutions for various disabilities](https://webaim.org/articles/userperspective/).
