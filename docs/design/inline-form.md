# Inline Form Design Guidelines

## Component Overview
Inline forms render in context in the current view instead of in a separate modal. It is most commonly used in grids and repeaters.

## Usage

### ✅ Use when

Use inline forms when the add or edit form is simple in terms of the number of fields and the complexity of the input controls.

Use inline forms when the surrounding content will not distract users from the add or edit task.

Use inline forms when users are highly likely to add multiple records in succession.

Use inline forms to add or edit a subsection within a larger modal form.

Use inline forms when users can abandon the task while the add or edit form is open.

For more details on adding and editing data, see managing data guidelines

### ❌ Don't use when

Don't use inline forms when the add or edit form requires a large amount of page morphing or users must scroll to complete the form.

Don't use inline forms within a paginated or infinite scroll list of items.

Don't use inline forms when users must finish the add or edit form before doing anything else.

## Anatomy

### Edit form

When users click the Edit button, the inline form replaces the view-only content.

### Primary buttons

The primary action on the inline form should be Save or Done.

Use Save if the inline form saves data to the database immediately.

Use Done if the inline form does not save data to the database immediately because it is part of a larger form.
