How to migrate
--------------

SKY UX didn't create a migration script because of differences between the Stache and SKY UX action buttons. Instead, SKY UX created the following AI prompt to manually migrate your code. An AI tool will speed up the migration, but be sure to review the output carefully because AI responses may not be 100 percent complete and accurate.
