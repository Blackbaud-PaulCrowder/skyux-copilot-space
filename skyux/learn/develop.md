Developing with Angular

[Angular](https://angular.io/) is at the heart of SKY UX, so developers need to be familiar with this technology. For training material, check out the [Angular resources.](https://angular.io/resources?category=education)

[Developer setup](/skyux/learn/develop/get-started.md) guides you through the initial setup and configuration and helps you display your first SKY UX component.

[Styles](/skyux/design/styles.md) are atomic visual design elements, such as color, typography, and spacing, that we use to create elegant, consistent experiences.

[Components](/skyux/components.md) are the building blocks that handle navigation, content organization, communication, and other interactions.

Not using Angular?
------------------

](/skyux/learn/develop#not-using-angular.md)

You can take advantage of SKY UX's versatile design language without using Angular components.

*   [Styles](/skyux/design/styles.md) define the exact values behind atomic visual design elements, such as color, typography, and spacing.
    
*   [Components](/skyux/components.md) encapsulate design patterns to ensure robust, effective UI elements across all user interface implementations.
    
*   [Guidelines](/skyux/design/guidelines.md) provide helpful patterns for a variety of scenarios, such as filtering lists and handling errors.
