# Sort Design Guidelines

## Component Overview
The sort button and menu let users select sorting criteria.

## Usage

### ✅ Use when

Use to sort a list of items when there are templated columns in a list. This provides a way for users to sort templated columns because there are no corresponding column headings.

### ❌ Don't use when

Do not include an additional sort button in the toolbar for a list when only data grid view is available. Column headers provide sorting in this case.
