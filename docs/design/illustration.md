# Illustration Design Guidelines

## Component Overview
Spot illustrations orient users and focus their attention across various experiences.

## Usage

### ✅ Use when

Use spot illustrations to focus user attention and shape visual hierarchy. Refer to the spot illustration design guidelines page to learn about their principles and role.

### ❌ Don't use when

Don't use spot illustrations as a visual shorthand to supplement action labels. Use icons instead.

## Options

### Size

Spot illustrations have four sizes: small, medium, large, and extra large.

## Layout

### Background color

Spot illustrations are duotone and use Blackbaud's color palette. To ensure clarity, only use them on light backgrounds.

### Alignment

To maintain visual balance, align spot illustrations vertically or horizontally with other elements, such as text, in the components and patterns where they appear.

### Standard layouts

To maintain visual balance, use SKY UX spacing values to separate elements.

###### Box call-to-action

Use small spot illustrations in this horizontal layout to draw user attention to important actions.

###### Welcome page

Use large spot illustrations within boxes to anchor content on welcome pages.

###### Split view empty state

Use medium spot illustrations in this vertical layout when split view lists include no remaining items.

## Spot illustration library

## Requesting a spot illustration

### 1. Determine what to communicate

Some user experiences require spot illustrations to communicate literal ideas, while others use them to tell stories or elicit emotion. The context and intent help determine the appropriate spot illustration for a user experience.

### 2. Select an illustration

Select the appropriate spot illustration from the Streamline Duotone library. Illustrations in the library are in spec mode and may not reflect final colors.

### 3. File a request form

Submit an illustration request in ADO.
