Deprecation
===========

As SKY UX evolves, sometimes features are replaced by newer patterns or no longer recommended for use. When a component or API is slated to be removed, we first mark it as deprecated. Deprecated features should no longer be pulled into new projects, and existing projects should plan to refactor as part of ongoing maintenance.

Deprecated features remain available within SKY UX, but they may be removed in the next major version.

Deprecation stages
------------------

#### Initial deprecation

When we deprecate a feature, we document the deprecation and flag the feature as deprecated in [linting](/skyux/learn/develop/linting.md). On the [Components page](/skyux/components.md), we highlight deprecated components, services, and modules, and the documentation for each deprecated feature includes a warning with a recommended path forward. In addition, the development docs for all components, services, and modules highlights any deprecated inputs, methods, or other properties and also recommends a path forward.

#### Maintenance mode

After deprecation, features remain in the public API, but maintenance is limited to critical issues. At the next major release, the SKY UX team evaluates whether to remove the feature.

#### Sunset

After we remove a feature, projects that rely on the feature need to move to an alternative to stay current with SKY UX.
