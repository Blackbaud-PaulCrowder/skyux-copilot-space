# Toggle Switch Design Guidelines

## Component Overview
The toggle switch lets users turn a SKY UX-themed switch "on" or "off." The change takes effect immediately.

## Usage

### ✅ Use when

Use toggles when users can toggle between two states or options, and the changes take effect immediately.

### ❌ Don't use when

Don't use toggles when the options have significant consequences that the users need to confirm before changes take effect. Use a workflow where users must confirm the changes instead.

Don't use toggles when the input is presented in a modal. Use checkboxes instead.

## Anatomy

- Toggle switch
- Label
- Help inline button

## Options

### Label

Text labels describe the properties that toggles control, and you can provide labels for both the selected and unselected states. Always include text labels unless other text clearly indicates the purpose of toggles. For example, when toggles are in grids, you can rely on column headings instead of text labels.

In scenarios where toggles may become disabled, always include labels for both the selected and unselected states to make those states clear to users.

### Help inline button

When you need to supplement a toggle switch label with additional information, you can place a help inline button beside the label to invoke contextual user assistance.
