Accessibility
=============

How to use SKY UX to deliver highly accessible experiences
----------------------------------------------------------

The SKY UX design system is designed, built, and tested to enable the design and development of accessible user experiences. The component library and code framework include many out-of-the-box accessibility features: good semantic markup, descriptive text equivalents, support for keyboard use, support for color contrast success criteria, and Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) roles and properties within components. Individual components also have accessibility guidelines where relevant.

The code framework is just one ingredient to deliver highly accessible experiences. To ensure the success of users with disabilities in your applications, use these additional practices, guidelines, and tools:

- [Design for accessibility](/skyux/learn/accessibility/design.md) - Principles and tools to design highly accessible experiences with SKY UX.
- [Code for accessibility](/skyux/learn/accessibility/code.md) - Best practices to use in your markup and custom components.
- [Test for accessibility](/skyux/learn/accessibility/test.md) - How to test your application to ensure it is highly accessible.

Is SKY UX accessible?
---------------------

An accessible UX framework is an important part of Blackbaud's commitment to deliver solutions that help drive positive change in the world. The SKY UX design system endeavors to support the World Wide Web Consortium's [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) Level A and AA success criteria.

To build an accessible application, you must leverage the technical tools and features built into SKY UX components and also understand how to use them effectively alongside accessibility best practices. While the SKY UX design system is designed with accessibility in mind, it doesn't guarantee compliance. Application developers must implement and test accessibility best practices to ensure their applications meet the required standards.
