# Status Indicator Design Guidelines

## Component Overview
Status indicators highlight important status information that users need to address.

## Usage

### ✅ Use when

Use status indicators when users must address or be aware of important information while completing tasks.

Use status indicators to call out important status information for items in a list or specific properties on a record.

Use status indicators to highlight validation errors on input fields.

### ❌ Don't use when

Don't use status indicators to highlight statuses in the page summary. Use labels instead.

Don't use status indicators when no user action is necessary and status information is not important enough to highlight. Use plain text instead to avoid the overuse of status indicators.

## Anatomy

- Icon
- Text label
- Help inline button

## Options

### Status type

### Description type

Use a description type with status indicators to include a text equivalent for the icon and color information. This ensures that people who use assistive technologies receive equivalent information.

### Help inline button

When you need to supplement a status indicator label with additional information but don't require persistent inline help, you can place a help inline button beside the label to invoke contextual user assistance.
