Spot illustrations
==================

Spot illustrations orient users and focus their attention across various experiences. Blackbaud's spot illustration library is only available for internal Blackbaud consumers. External consumers can source their own assets to use with the [spot illustration component](/skyux/components/illustration.md).

These guidelines provide general guidance on how Blackbaud designers can use spot illustrations in their designs, even though SKY UX components don't currently offer first-class support. We will update these guidelines with implementation details for spot illustrations as we determine them.

[

Principles
----------

](/skyux/design/guidelines/spot-illustrations#principles.md)

Spot illustrations are decorative illustrations that link concepts, drive emotions, and shape narratives. They simplify complex ideas and enhance the visual identity of Blackbaud applications. They are not innately interactive, but you can use them in specific scenarios to shape and support a page's visual hierarchy. Spot illustrations follow these principles:

### Functional

Spot illustrations shape a page's visual hierarchy and supplement text to drive the narrative for a feature or workflow.

### Contextual

The presence and use of spot illustrations reflects how we want users to feel within a particular user experience.

### Cohesive

Spot illustrations align with Blackbaud's brand aesthetic and personality and provide a consistent, cohesive user experience across features and workflows.

[

Content
-------

](/skyux/design/guidelines/spot-illustrations#content.md)

Spot illustrations enhance user comprehension. In addition to anchoring content containers to make them more visible within a page’s visual hierarchy, they work as a visual shorthand to communicate the purpose of their containers. Spot illustrations must provide context and work hand-in-hand with the surrounding text to deliver clear, cohesive messages to users.

In some cases, you can use a single spot illustration in multiple contexts to represent a variety of concepts. The ability to reuse a spot illustration this way depends on the particular use case and on the text that accompanies the spot illustration.

Do use spot illustrations and the surrounding text to communicate a cohesive message.

Usage
-----

### Use when

Use spot illustrations to focus user attention and shape visual hierarchy.

![undefined](https://sky.blackbaudcdn.net/skyuxapps/skyux/assets/img/guidelines/spot-illustrations/spot-illustration-sizing-do.dc83872c550eeee72c8e5022d59f535d.png)

Do use spot illustrations for illustrative purposes.

### Don't use when

Don't use spot illustrations as a visual shorthand to supplement action labels. Use [icons](/skyux/components/icon.md) instead.

Don't use spot illustrations in place of icons.

Options

### Size

Spot illustrations have four sizes: small, medium, large, and extra large.

To determine the size to use for a spot illustration, consider its placement within a page’s visual hierarchy, its use case, and the other elements that it's paired with.

#### Small (48px)

In small containers with limited text, such as [boxes](/skyux/components/box.md) or small [modals](/skyux/components/modal.md), use the small size. Most SKY UX experiences should use small illustrations.

#### Medium (64px)

In small containers where small spot illustrations lose emphasis in the visual hierarchy due to a large amount of text, use the medium size.

#### Large (80px)

In large containers with lots of text, such as large [modals](/skyux/components/modal.md), use the large size. Also, on pages where spot illustrations stand alone with a small amount of text, use the large size.

#### Extra Large (96px)

In general, don't use the extra large size. But on pages with no other content, you can pair extra large spot illustrations with text to communicate important messages.

Spot illustrations have four size variations.

[

Layout
------

](/skyux/design/guidelines/spot-illustrations#layout.md)

When placing spot illustrations within components or other page elements, follow the below design specifications to ensure their effectiveness.

### Background color

Spot illustrations are duotone and use Blackbaud's color palette. To ensure clarity, only use them on light backgrounds.

### Alignment

To maintain visual balance, align spot illustrations vertically or horizontally with other elements, such as text, in the components and patterns where they appear.

You can align spot illustrations horizontally to the left of other elements.

![undefined](https://sky.blackbaudcdn.net/skyuxapps/skyux/assets/img/guidelines/spot-illustrations/spot-illustration-alignment-vertical.e0e1542e240f73017ed1cfe79e85d217.png)

Illustrations can be centered vertically on top of accompanying text.

### Standard layouts

To maintain visual balance, use SKY UX spacing values to separate elements.

#### Box call-to-action

Use small spot illustrations in this horizontal layout to draw user attention to important actions.

Spacing for left-aligned illustrations and text.

#### Welcome page

Use large spot illustrations within boxes to anchor content on welcome pages.

Spacing values should scale with illustration size.

#### Split view empty state

Use medium spot illustrations in this vertical layout when split view lists include no remaining items.

Spacing for center-aligned illustrations and text.
