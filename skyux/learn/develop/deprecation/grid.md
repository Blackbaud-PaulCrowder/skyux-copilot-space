Grid
====

The [grid](/skyux/components/grid.md) component is deprecated in favor of the [data grid](/skyux/components/data-grid.md) component, but SKY UX plans to develop a new version of this feature after identifying value in a simplified approach for grids.

How to migrate
--------------

](/skyux/learn/develop/deprecation/grid#how-to-migrate.md)

SKY UX hasn't created a migration script because we won't have a clear migration path until we develop the new version of the feature. Teams can move away from the grid component on their own, but we intend to have tooling and better guidelines in the future.
