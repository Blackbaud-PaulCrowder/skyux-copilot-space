# Select Field Design Guidelines

## Component Overview
A select field creates a text input or button to launch a modal picker for users to select items from a searchable, browsable, and filterable list. Select field is deprecated. We will remove it in a future major version. In most cases, we recommend using the lookup component instead, but some scenarios require a different option, such as a selection box component or an HTML <select> element in an input box. For more information, review the select field deprecation instructions.

## Usage

### âœ… Use when

Use select fields when users don't know the exact values to select in long lists of items. For guidance on selection inputs for other scenarios, see the form design guidelines.
