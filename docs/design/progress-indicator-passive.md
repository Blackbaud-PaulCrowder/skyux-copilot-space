# Progress Indicator Passive Design Guidelines

## Component Overview
Passive progress indicators represent sequential steps in processes outside of user control.

## Usage

### ✅ Use when

Use passive progress indicators when users must be aware of sequential progress that they are not responsible for.

### ❌ Don't use when

Don't use passive progress indicators for tasks that require user interaction. Use waterfall progress indicators or wizards instead.

Don't use passive progress indicators to represent independent steps or statuses that are not sequential.

Don't use passive progress indicators simultaneously for multiple items in lists.
