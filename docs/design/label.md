# Label Design Guidelines

## Component Overview
Labels provide compact, eye-catching design elements to draw attention to time-sensitive status information that users need to address. Statuses indicate a state or condition within one of four categories: info, success, warning, and danger.

## Usage

### âœ… Use when

Use labels when statuses are crucial to user tasks. If not, use regular text.

## Options

### Label type

### Description type

Use a description type with labels to include a text equivalent for the icon and color information. This ensures that people who use assistive technologies receive equivalent information.

## Layout

### Label placement

Use labels in a summary context. For example, you can place a label in a page summary. To convey statuses inline to indicate that they are tied to specific pieces of data, use status indicators instead.
