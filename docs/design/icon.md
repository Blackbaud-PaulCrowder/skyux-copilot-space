# Icon Design Guidelines

## Component Overview
Icons represent actions, content, and ideas, and they help define the visual identity of SKY UX applications.

## Principles

### Global

Icons use well-established, universal images to visually convey meaning at a glance.

### Supplemental

Icons are paired with action labels and other text and are not used solely for decoration or visual interest.

### Specific

Icons convey a single meaning with limited variations. Each icon represents a common idea or subject that is not abstract.

## Usage

### ✅ Use when

Use icons alongside meaningful action labels to help users understand the purpose of actions at a glance.

### ❌ Don't use when

Don't use icons solely for visual interest or decoration.

Don't use icons for multiple purposes. Each icon conveys a single, specific meaning that users can understand at a glance.

## Behavior and states

### Color

Icons use solid, monochromatic colors that they usually inherit from their parent components. Icon colors must meet the WCAG contrast ratio of 3:1. For more information, see the SKY UX color guidelines.

### Style

SKY UX icons have two style variations: line and solid. Use line icons for most user experiences.

### Size

Use the default icon size, medium or m, when including icons in buttons or for use with standard body copy. Only use smaller or larger icon sizes when pairing an icon with smaller or larger content to match to its paired content or better fit its context.

### Localization

SKY UX icons account for global considerations to ensure that international users from different cultures and backgrounds can understand them.
