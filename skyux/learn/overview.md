Welcome to SKY UX!
==================

Blackbaud's design system enables delightful, consistent user experiences across our solutions. Use our reusable interaction patterns, Angular components, design tokens, and code library to build your features into Blackbaud solutions and services.

The primary benefit of SKY UX is the scalability of reliable, proven designs and implementations. You can focus on solving problems for users instead of granular decisions about UI controls, visual design, or layouts. Users benefit from the consistent, cohesive workflows and interactions.
