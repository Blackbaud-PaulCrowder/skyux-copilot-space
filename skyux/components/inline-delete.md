==========================

The inline delete confirmation appears when users delete an item in a list and requires them to confirm that they want to delete the item.

 Usage
------

### Use when

Use the inline delete confirmation when users need to confirm that they want to delete an item from a list.

Keep in mind that you should not delete items from lists when they are complex enough to have their own record pages. For lists with such items, do not include delete actions in the [context-menu dropdowns](/skyux/components/dropdown.md).

Do use inline delete confirmation when deleting an item from a list.

### Don't use when

Don't use inline delete confirmation when users need to confirm that they want to delete an item outside of a list. Use a [confirm dialog](/skyux/components/confirm.md) instead.
